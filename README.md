# Reverseshell-code

Hello, this repository contains accumulated reverse shell codes from different sources, please feel free to contribute.

Bash-reverse_shell - It works on Linux, as nearly all Linux systems come with this system shell.

Pearl-reverse_shell - a perl interpreter should be available on most Linux servers, so a perl command might be another way to obtain a reverse shell.

PHP-reverse_shell - Most web servers will have PHP installed, and this too can provide a reverse shell vector (if the file descriptor &3 doesn’t work, you can try subsequent numbers)

Java-reverse_shell - Java is likely to be available on application servers

Ruby-reverse_shell - Ruby is another popular web application language that’s likely to have an interpreter on a general-purpose server system.

Powershell-reverse_shell -
